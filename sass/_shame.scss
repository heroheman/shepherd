// Try:  $ git blame _shame.scss

// Rules:
//     Obviously you need some kind of rules and criteria:

//     1. If itâ€™s a hack, it goes in _shame.scss.
//     2. Document all hacks fully:
//     3. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
//     4. Why was this needed?
//     5. How does this fix it?
//     6. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
//     7. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
//     8. Try and clean _shame.scss up when you have some down time.
//         Even better, get tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.

// Example:

    // Nav specificity fix.

    // Someone used an ID in the header code (`#header a{}`) which trumps the
    // nav selectors (`.site-nav a{}`). Use !important to override it until I
    // have time to refactor the header stuff.

    // .site-nav a{
    //     color:#BADA55!important;
    // }
