## Introduction
Shepherd Framework is my attempt of creating a CSS starter kit for my daily work. I try to include Best Practices from the Frontend Development Community without the bloat. Also its focused on Responsive Webdesign - but its also usable for old school websites.
It's running on [SASS](http://www.sass-lang.com) and is using the principles of [SMACSS](http://www.smacss.com) and [OOCSS](http://www.oocss.org). Shepherd makes use of the placeholder feature introduced in SASS 3.2, so even its feature rich, its not in your final CSS when you don't use it.

Its not a Framework like [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) or [Zurb's Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) - if you want already styled components **I suggest to try the former mentioned Tools.**

## RIGHT NOW IN DEVELOPMENT - USE ON OWN RISK!!!
Its right now in an early alpha stage but its usable - but don't expect an easy update in a working project.

## DOCUMENTATION
I will provide a small documentation when i think its usable by the public.

## SASS? Why not Compass?
Shepherd is designed with [Compass](http://compass-style.org) in mind, but its not necessary. Basic mixins are provided e.g. the vendorize function. There is a config.rb in the root folder, so you could also use compass commands (if installed).

## Installation
- Install Sass
- Clone this Project
- Navigate to your project
- use "sass --watch sass/style.scss:css/style.css"
